## Installation

You can install the package via composer: 

```
composer require faresmts/safewords
```

## Usage

This is the simplest way to call a safewords checker: 
```
$isSafe = SafeWords::filter($text)
            ->isSafe()
            ->get();
```
And this is the way to call a safewords censor:
```
$censoredText = SafeWords::filter($text)
                       ->replace()
                       ->get();
```

### Functions

`filter($text)`: add the text you want to check.

`isSafe()`: method that evaluates whether the text is safe.

`replace($string)`: method that replaces each character of the bad word with the variable inside $string. Default is '*'.

`get()`: get the result of the chosen method.

Obs.: the methods `isSafe()` and `replace()` cannot be called at the same time, throwing an exception.
